  <h1>🌀 ZigZagRunner</h1>

  <p><strong>ZigZagRunner</strong> is a fast-paced, reflex-based endless runner game built with <strong>Unity</strong> using <strong>C#</strong> for the game logic, and <strong>ASP.NET</strong> powering backend features such as leaderboard management and player data (if applicable). Inspired by the original <em>ZigZag</em> game from Ketchapp, your goal is simple: guide the runner along a winding, narrow path, tapping left or right at the right time. Miss a turn — and it’s game over!</p>

  <p>This project serves as both a learning exercise and a fun playable experience for fans of minimalist arcade games.</p>
